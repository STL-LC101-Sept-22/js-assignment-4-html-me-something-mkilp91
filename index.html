                  <p class ="normal-text">I wish I could say that I was one of those people who knew from the moment they were destined to be a photographer. The truth is, I didn't even consider the idea of using a camera as a profession until my late 20s. It wasn't until my wife started shooting photography that the art piqued my interest. Photography at its core is very technically complex, with explicit rules and parameters that affect the quality of the end result (the captured photograph). Undoubtedly, photography is made possible by "left-brain" "black-and-white" engineering. However, the technical foundation facilitates a medium in which the user's creativity can be fully unleashed. Ironically, photography is very similar programming in this way. Our ability to use objective science to create a tool for creating subjective art is at the heart of why I love photography (and programming). </p>
