                  <p class="normal-text">I wish I could say that I was one of those people who knew from the moment they were destined to be a photographer. The truth is, I didn't even consider the idea of using a camera as a profession until my late 20s. It wasn't until my wife started shooting photography that the art piqued my interest. Photography at its core is very technically complex, with explicit rules and parameters that affect the quality of the end result (the captured photograph). Undoubtedly, photography is made possible by "left-brain" "black-and-white" engineering. However, the technical foundation facilitates a medium in which the user's creativity can be fully unleashed. Ironically, photography is very similar programming in this way. Our ability to use objective science to create a tool for creating subjective art is at the heart of why I love photography (and programming). </p>

                  <p class="normal-text">After months of reading manuals, watching YouTube videos, and learning as much technical photography information as possible, we landed our first paid gig. One thing led to another and my wife and I started a wedding photography and videography business called <a class="normal-text" href="https://rootsoftherose.com/">Roots of the Rose Photo & Film Co.</a> Not only are we life partners, but we are also business partners!

                  <p class ="normal-text">With the skills gained from shooting over 100 weddings I have started applying my camera skills to different genres of photography. I am inspired by everything from <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/photography">National Geographic's</a> stunning nature photos to the loud and rowdy punk rock shows at <a href="https://blueberryhill.com/shows/">Blueberry Hill's Duck Room</a>. Here are a few examples of some of my work:</p>

                  <p class ="normal-text">Luckily, I learned to shoot photography in the digital format. The ability to shoot upwards of 15+ photos per second, see what the photo looks like immediately after you captured it, and use a RAW file format to edit a photo to your heart's content makes the digital format undeniably superior to the old analog film format... or does it?</p>
                  <p> In May of 2022 I stumbled across my parents old <a href="https://global.canon/en/c-museum/product/film103.html">Canon AE-1 Program</a> 35mm film camera. After convincing my parents that letting me borrow it would be better than it collecting dust in a closet, I set off to learn the roots of photography. I discovered several advantages and disadvantages to shooting film vs digital.</p>

                  <h3 class="comp-header" id="subheader">The Pro's:</h3>
                  <ul id="comp-bullets">
                     <li>The texture of the photos is unmatched by digital.</li>
                     <li>You tend to be more mindful when shooting because each shot costs you money.</li>
                     <li>There is a romanticism tied with the photo being chemical reaction using the actual light captured, rather than a digital measurement of light using processors and binary sensors.</li>
                     <li>There is an element of surpise that you get when your developed roll comes back from the camera shop.</li>
                  </ul>
                    <h3 class="comp-header" id="subheader">The Con's:</h3>
                    <ul id="comp-bullets">
                       <li>It's very expensive compared to digital photography.
                     </li>
                     <li>You have to change rolls after 24 or 26 exposures, increasing the likelyhood that you will miss a great moment.</li>
                     <li>The suprise of not knowing what you are going to get is way more stressful when someone is paying you.</li>
                     <li>You have to wait, or buy expensive chemicals to develop your negatives</li>

                    <p id="final-text">Overall, I found a great appreciation for the art of film photography. While the general fundamentals of photography are the same between digital and film, I feel that the two mediums are entirely different art forms. In the end, the thrill of documenting life in a unique way, be it digital or analog, is why I love photography. </p>
